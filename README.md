# Welcome!

I am not really sure what this is to be honest. The general idea behind this is a community wiki.

A community wiki created by users, governed by users. Anyone can edit. Anyone can submit. With a simple catch.

Posts must be approved by peers.

This is powered by Pykwiki all content source is written in markdown and converted to static content (HTML and JS)

Where to go from here:

* Submit a Pull Request
* That PR will be approved or denied by repo collaborators
* Your work goes live

I would like to be a Collaborator:

* Open an issue others will vote to enstate you as one.
